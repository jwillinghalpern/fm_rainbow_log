# FM Rainbow Log (fmrl)

`fmrl` (pronounced like Earl with a "fmuh") is a cross-platform command line tool to:

- ðŸ¥¸ watch FileMaker Import.log files for changes
- ðŸ¦„ colorize the output
- ðŸš¨ and highlight errors and warnings.

It displays real-time updates for both custom Import.log paths as well as the default (Documents) location when working with hosted fmp12 files.

## Motivation

FileMaker's Import.log file is helpful when importing/copying between files, but it's difficult to parse visually. Errors and warnings get buried, and columns don't align. Plus, the default macOS log viewer, Console.app wraps lines unnecessarily ðŸ¤¨.

Furthermore, FileMaker calcs don't play nice with other CLI utilities like `tail` because they sometime use non-standard `\r` line endings. `fmrl` appends linefeeds as needed so messages aren't truncated when printing in the terminal.

## Installation

If installing locally, I prefer using cargo (described below), because it streamlines updates and avoids macos permission issues. But pre-compiled binaries are also available.

### Via pre-compiled binaries

1. Copy the `fmrl` binary (see below) to a directory in your PATH. For example, `/usr/local/bin` on macOS.
    - To see the folders in your PATH, run this in your terminal: `echo $PATH | sed -E 's/:/\n/g'`
2. Restart your terminal and type `fmrl --help`.

Binaries are available in the [Releases section](https://github.com/jwillinghalpern/fm_rainbow_log/releases).

NOTE: On macOS, the first time you run the program you'll encounter a security warning. [See here](./readme-files/macos-security.md)

### Via ðŸ¦€ rust/cargo

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/jwillinghalpern/fm_rainbow_log.git
```

To update fmrl, re-run the above command any time.

If you don't have cargo, [follow this one easy step](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

### Development/contribution

Simply clone this repo, cd to the directory, and run `cargo run` to test in debug mode. If you are planning a big feature or change, please open an issue first to discuss.

## Usage

watch Import.log in current directory:

```bash
fmrl
```

watch Import.log in your local Documents directory (default location when working with hosted files):

```bash
fmrl --docs-dir
# fmrl -d
```

print a separator between each import operation:

```bash
fmrl -s
```

watch for only errors and warnings:

```bash
fmrl  --errors-only --warnings-only
# fmrl -e -w
```

show desktop notifications for errors and warnings:

```bash
fmrl --notifications
```

show help (it's helpful)

```bash
fmrl --help
```

play sound! (mac only)

```bash
fmrl --beep
# or make it fancier!
fmrl --notifications --beep --beep-volume 0.8 --beep-path /System/Library/Sounds/Frog.aiff
```

specify custom config/colors file:

```bash
fmrl -c path/to/config.json
```

don't watch for changes, just print the log once:

```bash
fmrl --no-watch
```

generate an auto-completion script (store somewhere in your $fpath):

```bash
# zsh example. Omit "zsh" to see shell options.
fmrl --completion zsh

# here's where I put it
fmrl --completion zsh > ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_fm_rainbow_log
```

### Customize with `config.json` (recommended)

To customize colors and default options, create config/json file. All keys are optional, e.g. you can omit "background" for any field, or omit the field entirely.

```json
{
  "show_separator": false,
  "use_documents_directory": false,
  "errors_only": false,
  "warnings_only": false,

  "show_notifications": false,

  "beep": false,
  "beep_volume": 1.0,
  "beep_path": "/System/Library/Sounds/Tink.aiff",

  "colors": {
    "timestamp": {
      "foreground": "bright white",
      "background": "magenta"
    },
    "filename": {
      "foreground": "black",
      "background": "cyan"
    },
    "error": {
      "foreground": "bright white",
      "background": "bright green"
    },
    "message": {
      "foreground": "bright white",
      "background": "black"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Where to store the config

either:

1. pass in the path with the `-c/--config` option:

    ```bash
    fmrl -c path/to/config.json
    ```

2. or... (recommended for default config) save the file in one of these locations and then fmrl will use that by default:

- Mac: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/fm_rainbow_log/config.json`
  - example: `/Users/Alice/Library/Application Support/fm_rainbow_log/config.json`
- Windows: `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}\fm_rainbow_log\config.json`
  - example: `C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming\fm_rainbow_log\config.json`

_If you have a default config.json, you can override it by passing a different path to the `-c` option._

#### Colors

`fmrl` supports both ANSI and truecolor. ANSI colors are the standard 16 colors supported by most terminals, whereas truecolor is a newer standard. Some terminals including macOS Terminal.app _do not_ support truecolor, but modern terminals like iTerm2, Alacritty, and Warp do. You can define truecolors as rgb or hex (see below).

##### ANSI format

| color   | bright version |
| ------- | -------------- |
| black   | bright black   |
| red     | bright red     |
| green   | bright green   |
| yellow  | bright yellow  |
| blue    | bright blue    |
| magenta | bright magenta |
| cyan    | bright cyan    |
| white   | bright white   |

##### Truecolor format

rgb: `rgb(255, 0, 255)`

hex: `#ff00ff`

## Notes

- Most terminals let you customize the ANSI colors, so feel free to tweak the appearance to your liking!
- On Windows I've only tested PowerShell. There are certain cases where the color escape sequences don't display properly, and show garbled text. I'm not sure how to handle every edge case (please submit suggestions/pull requests if you do).
